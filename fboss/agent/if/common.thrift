  // 1) We rely on the arithmetic properties of 0 for ECMP vs UCMP route
  //    resolution calculations. A 0 weight next hop being present at a variety
  //    of layers in a route resolution tree will cause the entire route
  //    resolution to use ECMP.

  //    0 being populated even with strange behavior in the client language
  //    which is consistent with C++
